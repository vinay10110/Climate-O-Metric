# Climate-O-Metric üåçüìä
*A Hackathon Project on Climate Data Analytics*

This project was developed as part of the Climate-O-Metric Hackathon, which consisted of 3 rounds focused on data analytics (first two rounds) and predictive insights (third round).
The challenge provided real-world climate datasets, and the goal was to clean, preprocess, analyze, and present actionable insights.

---

## Overview
Climate-O-Metric brings together multi-round analyses across climate indicators, energy systems, and emissions to surface trends and insights that matter. The work spans:
- Round 1: Foundational analytics and country-level sustainability insights
- Round 2: Thematic deep-dives with dedicated dashboards
- Round 3: Light predictive modeling for forward-looking insight

No setup instructions are included here by design‚Äîthis document focuses on the project‚Äôs structure, scope, methods, and outcomes.

## Round 1 ‚Äî Sustainability & Core Indicators
Country-level analytics built from multiple public datasets (CO‚ÇÇ per capita, renewable electricity share, greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural land %, and electricity consumption per capita). Core steps included:
- Data cleaning and reformatting; deriving comparable time-series per country
- Lightweight preprocessing to align temporal coverage across datasets
- Consolidated visuals for cross-metric context and benchmarking

## Round 2 ‚Äî Thematic Deep-Dives (Dashboards)
Each subproject focuses on a distinct aspect of the climate-energy system with curated datasets, preprocessing, and a dedicated dashboard.

- Climate & Temperatures
  - Global and country-level temperature trends and anomalies
  - Annual means and multi-decade patterns for context

- Consumption & Generation
  - Power generation mixes (renewables vs. non-renewables)
  - Country comparisons and changes over time

- Emissions and Pollutions
  - Emissions footprints and forest/carbon context
  - Trendlines to highlight inflection points

- General energy data
  - Broad energy KPIs for orientation across countries
  - Harmonized views to support comparisons

- Powerplants
  - Country-level plant counts and capacity trends
  - Summary visuals of infrastructure concentration

## Round 3 ‚Äî Predictive Insight 
In the final round, we were provided with a dataset named Country_Pollution_Stats.csv, containing climate and pollution-related statistics for different countries.

The dataset had 217 rows and 20 columns, with information such as:

Country-level details: region_id, country_name, population_population_number_of_people, gdp.

Waste composition percentages: food/organic, glass, metal, paper/cardboard, plastic, rubber/leather, wood, yard/garden, and others.

Special waste data (tons/year): agricultural, construction/demolition, e-waste, hazardous, industrial, and medical.

Climate impact: Temperature Change.

A Jupyter Notebook (l3.ipynb) demonstrating the preprocessing, analysis, and model training steps.

Predicted future trends and insights for climate-related decision-making.

## Data & Assets
Representative datasets used across rounds include:
- CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita, total greenhouse gas emissions
- Renewable electricity share of generation
- Agricultural land percentage
- Global and country temperature time-series
- Power generation and consumption by source
- Forest and carbon summaries

Dashboards and visuals are provided as PBIX files and exported images for quick review.
